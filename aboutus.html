        <h2>Project Reflection:</h2>
        <p>
            This was a fun project.  I had worked with HTML lightly in the past but never with
            CSS and never with embedding JavaScript or analytics.  I had to stop myself or I 
            would just keep adding features until I spent 1000 hours on it.  I used professor 
            Daniels' example for the analytics piece and threw some ballpark numbers in there 
            from google to get a graphic up.  One thing I couldn't get to work right was the 
            setting the max and min on the y axis, not sure why it won't take, would love to 
            hear feedback.  For the rest of the project I pulled from different examples I 
            found searching around the internet.  I bootstrapped a form for the guestbook then
            added some functionality with JS to satisfy the CRUD requirement.  Some customization
            too.  I made a simple guess who game with some added trivia hidden by css 
            functionality to the home page.
        </p>
        <P>
            Considerations for improvements for this are nearly endless.  First, I would dedicate
            more time to getting the call to the main.js to function properly such that the scripting
            can be left in it's own file.  Second, I would bring in
            a light database to support the guest book and analytics.  Possibly sqLite ot MySql.
            Could even be supported by csv files.  The gray scale is minimally okay, I 
            would like to explore more color palletes.  But this is something where I would spend 
            90% of my time trying to perfect the last 5% of the project.  I would spend too much 
            time on it.  Gray scale works.  More background graphics and animations throughout the 
            site would liven it up as well.
        </P>
        <p>
            Again, I really enjoyed this project.  This is my first real exposure to front end 
            development and I like it more than I expected.
